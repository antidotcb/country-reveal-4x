# Privacy Policy for Country Revealer

Last Updated: `November 24, 2025`

This Privacy Policy describes how Country Revealer for X ("the Extension") handles your data. We are committed to
transparency and do not collect, sell, or transmit your personal data to third parties.

## 1. Data Collection and Usage

### No Remote Telemetry

The Extension operates entirely locally on your device. We do not maintain external servers, and we do not collect usage
analytics, browsing history, or personal identifiers.

### Authentication Cookies

To function, the Extension accesses specific authentication cookies (ct0 and auth_token) associated with your active
session on X (formerly Twitter).

* Purpose: These keys are used solely to authenticate requests to the X public GraphQL API to fetch the "About Account"
  data (Country of Origin) for the profiles you view.
* Storage: These keys are never permanently stored, logged, or transmitted to the developer or any third party. They
  remain within your browser's secure memory.

### Local Caching

The Extension saves fetched public profile data (e.g., Country, Username Changes) to your browser's local storage (
chrome.storage.local).

* Purpose: To reduce network requests to X and prevent rate-limiting on your account.
* Control: You can clear this data at any time by clicking the "Clear Database" button in the extension popup or by
  clearing your browser's cache.

## 2. Third-Party Services

The Extension communicates directly with:

* X (formerly Twitter): To retrieve public profile information. This communication is subject to X's Terms of Service
  and Privacy Policy.

## 3. Data Disclosure

We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your information to outside parties.

## 4. User Consent

By using the Extension, you consent to this Privacy Policy.

## 5. Contact

If you have questions regarding this privacy policy, you may contact the developer via the Chrome Web Store support tab.

## 6. Disclaimer of Warranty and Limitation of Liability
